# FreeTAKServer

![the Parrot is not dead](https://github.com/Tapawingo/FreeTakServer/blob/master/docs/FreeTakServer%20specs/FreeTakServerLogo.png?raw=true)

Welcome to the FreeTakServer (FTS) git repository.

FTS  is a Python3 implementation of the TAK Server for devices like CivTAK , WinTAK and ITAK, it is cross-platform. We use the Flask framework for web services. 
it's free and open source  (released under the Eclipse Public License).

## Use cases
FTS allows you to connect ATAK clients to share geo information, to chat with all the connected clients, exchange files and more.
It intends to support all the major use cases of the original TAK server.

## Community 
This code is currently in *Early Production Stage*
Check out our roadmap @ FreeTakServer#25 to see what is planned
If you have any issues don't hesitate to bring it up https://github.com/Tapawingo/FreeTakServer/issues,  as TAKFreeServer is  in contionous development.

### Donate back
the FTS team is working  daily on the development of a open and free solution. We plan to do more that simply replicate the functionalities of the legacy TAK server, our road map includes integration with open source systems like LORA's Meshtastic, porting it to Android, having an open API and much more.

We are doing it for free because we believe that donating personal time to a cause its a endeavour that is worthy per-se, However, a part time, we are also spending our own money  to:
- Maintain a Public server and a test server
- Investing in different technologies for R&D

if you feel that FTS is useful to you and you can donate in those challenging times please consider to send you contribution here:

NOTE:
not a big fan of Paypal, but that is the easier way I found for an initial attempt. We may go to some more ethical system in future.

### Public instance
we support a [public instance}(https://www.reddit.com/r/ATAK/wiki/index/freetakserver) of FTS.
- download the configuration {here}(https://drive.google.com/open?id=1IK1LfPN13EWikHaMyOuDDwIerNGz-Wl)
- use the Import manager in ATAK to import the configuration

## Architecture
TAKFreeServer uses a MVC pattern, the concept of a COT is described in a set of Domain classes, generated  from the UML model using a Model Driven Architecture approach.
![the domain model with all the know objects used by CIVTAK/ wintak](https://github.com/FreeTAKTeam/FreeTakServer/blob/master/docs/FreeTAKServer%20Model.png)
YOu can see the complete COT description   {here}(https://github.com/FreeTAKTeam/FreeTakServer/blob/master/docs/FreeTakServer%20specs/COTDomainModel.pdf)

## Documentation
under /docs, you can find various documents including an UML model of the Domain classes involved in a COT event.

## Requirements
- Python  3.6 (or better)
following Python libraries are required and will be installed automatically by Pip: flask, lxml, pathlib, tabulate, sqlalchemy, setuptools, Flask-SQLAlchemy

## Installing and using FreeTakServer
the following are the instructions to install FTS 1.1 or better. Past versions can have different procedures.
Important Note: depending from the system you are using, the following commands may be executed using  python3, Pip3 or in alternative python, Pip (without the 3).

### Prerequisites
you will need to install Python 3 and PIP before you can install FTS

- Install Python3 and PIP
```
  sudo apt update && sudo apt install python3 && sudo apt install pip3` (Ubuntu)```
 ```
### install FreeTakServer
Since version 0.8, FTS supports Pip installation, manual installation can be done with some modifications of the import paths, however we don't support it

```
  sudo python3 -m pip install FreeTAKServer 
```

Optional: check if installation is correctly executed and install any missing packages if prompted
```
pip check FreeTakServer 
```
if you find a missing package you can install it with Pip. For example
```
$ sudo pip3 install flask_socketio and
$ sudo pip3 install flask_cors
```

use 
```
python3 -m pip show FreeTAKServer
``` 
to find the path to FreeTAKServer
e.g. under windows it's installed under
```
C:\Users\user.name\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\PythonXX\Lib\site-packages\FreeTAKServer
```

### Installing specific versions
if you need, you can install a specific version of FTS by this command
```
sudo python3 -m pip install FreeTAKServer==xxx
```
you can see a list of versions here
https://pypi.org/project/FreeTAKServer/#history 

### Docker Container
Information on our official container can be found here
https://github.com/FreeTAKTeam/FreeTAKServer-Docker

Please create issues on the FreeTAKServer-Docker regarding inquries regarding the use of docker.

## configuration
before the first startup go to the installation dir and the FreeTAKServer/controllers/configuration/MainConfig.py
here change as follows,

from:
```
DBFilePath = str(currentPath + r'\FTSDataBase.db')
```

to:
```
DBFilePath = str('/a/dir/to/store/the/db/FTSDataBase.db')
```

## Run FreeTakServer
### Linux

#### Run Server in console

```
sudo  python3 -m FreeTAKServer.controllers.services.FTS -DataPackageIP [YourIP]
```
this will start the server with Port 8087 and API port 8080 on the IP defined in [yourIP]

other parameters you can use:
-AutoStart: (weather the full server start or just the RestAPI, must be True or False)
 -CoTIP [yourIP] 
 -DataPackageIP[yourIP] : set the IP where CoTs are send
 -CoTPort [aPort] : the port you want clients to connect to
 -DataPackagePort [anotherPort]: the port you want datapackages to be sent and received on
 
if you dont set any of the above, FTS will adopt a "Convention instead of Configuration" approach and try to set all from the configuation file

Open a new console in a separate window
run  FTS Command Line Interface  with 
```
python -m FreeTAKServer.views.CLI
```
following command are supported:
start_all: to begin all services type
start_CoT_service: to begin CoT service type
start_data_package_service: to begin data package service  type
stop_all: to terminate all services type
stop_CoT_service: to terminate CoT service type
stop_data_package_service: to begin data package service type
change_connection_info: change the address and port of the server you're connecting to
show_users: to show connected user information type
kill: to kill the full server type
show_DP: to show all DataPackages on the server
remove_DP: to remove a DataPackages on the server

to get a list of other supported commands type 

```help```

#### Run Server as Demon
use this command in Ubuntu to run FTS independently from your command window.

```
sudo nohup python3 -m FreeTAKServer.controllers.services.FTS -DataPackageIP [YourIP] &
```

### Windows
go to the start menu and type ```cmd``` to start a command prompt

open a console with admin rights
Powershell has issues so do not use it
```
python3 -m FreeTAKServer.controllers.services.FTS -DataPackageIP [YourIP]
```

### Troubleshooting
#### package not found'
if, trying to start FTS you get an error 'package not found'
```
'package not found'
```
navigate to the physical location where the controllers are installed and start the server from there.

You may also check for missing libraries and install then using Pip

#### issue connecting in WinTAK
if you have issues connecting winTAK to FTS, try to deactivate the TAKChat plugin, under the plugin section

## Update FreeTakServer
if you already installed FTS with pip you can use
```
pip install FreeTAKServer --upgrade
```

### client2client datapackages

If you have issues sending datapackages directly to clients via FTS, make sure -IP you specified can be reached from your device.  
A quick way to test if it works is to take a picture with Quick Pic in ATAK and send it to another client. Please also note that for that test ATAK clients needs to be on different network (ie one on mobile and one on wifi), because if you run them in same network (wifi, vpn, etc) they will just use same multicast group, bypassing FTS completely.  
When you post package to specific contact in ATAK, following happens:  

  1) Datapackage is uploaded to server, recorded in database and stored in FTS directory  
  2) Client receives payload with URL pointing to datapackage so ATAK can download it   

Assuming you want to run open-to-everyone FTS instance, and you have server hosted somewhere, you need to specify _public_ IP address in -IP argument. And just in case, -IP also accepts domain names.   
If you run it at home and port forward on router doesn't work, check if you receive actual IP address and not being NATed and ports 8080 and 8087 are not filtered - you can ask your ISP about that.

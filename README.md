Welcome to the FreeTakServer (FTS) git repository.

FTS is a Python3 implementation of a TAK Server for devices like [ATAK](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.atakmap.app.civ), [WinTAK](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AtMVrrXVTu4YgSanKtSHIslxfRu5?e=ftVio7), and ITAK, it is cross-platform and runs from a multi node installation on AWS down to the Android edition.
It's free and open source (released under the [Eclipse Public License](https://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-2.0/).

## User Documentation

For documentation on installation and usage visit our [FreeTAKServer Documentation page](https://freetakteam.github.io/FreeTAKServer-User-Docs/)

## Use Cases

FTS allows you to connect ATAK clients to share geo information, to chat with all the connected clients, exchange files and more.
It intends to support all the major use cases of the original TAK server.

- Web administration
- Federation Service (Connecting two or more FTS instances)
- Data Package upload, share with all connected users and retrieval
- Image transfer and storage
- COT recording in a database
- Execution of common task list (_using the ExCheck plugin for WinTAK; ATAK plugin only available to users with takmaps.com access_)
- SSL Encryption
- KML generation
- Command Line Interface
- [Extensive REST API](https://freetakteam.github.io/FreeTAKServer-User-Docs/API/REST_APIDoc/) for integrations and extensions

## Architecture

TAKFreeServer uses a MVC pattern, the concept of a COT (Cursor On Target) is described in a set of Domain classes, generated from the UML model using a Model Driven Architecture approach.

## Documentation

See [user docs](https://freetakteam.github.io/FreeTAKServer-User-Docs/) for various information including an UML model of the Domain classes involved in a COT event.

## Donate

The FTS team is working daily on the development of an open and free solution. We plan to do more than simply replicate the functionalities of the legacy TAK server, our road map includes integration with open source systems like LORA's Meshtastic, porting it to Android, having an open API, and much more.

We are doing it for free because we believe that donating personal time to a cause is an endeavour that is worthy per-se, However, we are also spending our own time and money to:

- Maintain a Public server and a test server
- Invest in different technologies for R&D

If you feel that FTS is useful to you and you can donate in those challenging times please consider contributing here:
[DONATE](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations&business=brothercorvo%40gmail.com&item_name=FreeTAKServer+R%26D&currency_code=CAD&source=url)

You can also support the project by buying one of our [t-shirts](http://tee.pub/lic/elARpZYCmaw).

**_NOTE_**:

> Not a big fan of Paypal, but that is the easiest way I found for an initial attempt. We may go to some more ethical system in future.
> Finally you can help the project by spamming FTS information, starring our repositories in github and Pip and upvoting us.
